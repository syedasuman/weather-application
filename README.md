LANGUAGES ARE:

To make this application, we're going to need to cover the following languages:

• HTML - the information represented on the page.

• CSS - the style or look of the information.

• Javacsript - the programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage.

• API (Application Programming Interface) - where and how we get the weather data.

• JSON - the weather data.

• jQuery - a javascript library that makes web programming a bit easier for us.
